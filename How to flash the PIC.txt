To Flash the PIC:

1) Install the MPLAB IDE

- MPLABX-v4.05-windows-installer (on project DVD in the folder 'mplab')
- This installs the MPLAB IPE, needed to flash the pic with a .hex

2) Start MPLAB IPE v4.05

3) Under 'Device:' select PIC18F4680

4) At the 'Settings' menu, select 'Release from Reset'

5) 'Tool:' should be set to PICKIT 3 (must be plugged into the USB before starting MPLAB IPE)

6) Connect the PICKIT 3 to your board with the programming cable.

*IMPORTANT*

You must get the polarity of the programming cable of the PICKIT right. 
It can overheat and damage the PICKIT or the PCB

- There is a TRIANGLE on the PICKIT which indicates Pin 1
- This wire must connect to Pin 1 of the programming header on the PCB
- Whichever wire color is connected to the 'TRIANGLE' pin must connect to the first pin of the header (same wire color)
- Pin 1 of the header is at the top edge of the board and on the PCB silkscreen is labelled 'MCLR/VPP'
- Example: PICKIT triangle is connected to green wire, 'MCLR/VPP' should also be connected to the green wire

7) Power on the board with the ON/OFF switch.

*IMPORTANT*

The MPLAB IPE will not connect to your board with the PCB slide switch OFF.
The PICKIT can't supply enough current to power the entire PCB on it's own.

8) Click 'Connect'

- The PICKIT should connect to the board and indicate this in the 'Output' screen.
- It will then ask you to verify that the microcontroller connected is a 5V part. Just click 'Ok'.
- If it doesn't work, you may need to close the MPLAB IPE, unplug the USB and re-plug it in, and restart the IPE.
- Try connecting again.

9) Load your .HEX

- Click 'Browse' and select your .hex (machine code) from whichever folder you have saved it in.
- The 'Output' screen should say 'Hex file loaded successfully'.

10) Click 'Program'

- If it didn't work, check over these steps again and re-try.
- If successful, the 'Pass Count' should increase by one.
- The 7 segment display should run a display test, first printing 'tEst' and then '8.8.8.8'

Done!

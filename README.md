Note: new versions of MPLAB X and the XC8 compiler do not work!

Please use the following ide, compiler and the necessary peripheral library

MPLAB X v4.05

XC8 v1.45

PIC18F Legacy Peripheral Libraries v2.0

After installing all of these, you will have to link the peripheral library.

1) right click the project name
2) select "Properties"
3) under "XC8 global options", select "XC8 linker"
4) scroll down and check "Link in Peripheral Library"
5) the program should compile now
